The goal is to reach 21 or get as close as possible without exceeding it.
Each player gets 2 cards; you can "Hit" (draw more) or "Stand" (keep your hand).
Number cards are worth their value; J, Q, K are worth 10; Ace is 1 or 11.
If you exceed 21, you lose automatically.
In a tie, the dealer and the player push (no one wins or loses).
The closest to 21 without exceeding wins.
